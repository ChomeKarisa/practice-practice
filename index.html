   <h1>TAPENADE (olive Spread ) RECIPE</h1>
   <P>This is a really simple dish to prepare and it's always a big hit at parties. My father recommends: <br>
<BLockquote>Make this the night before so that the flavors have time to blend. Just bring it up to the room <br>
temprature before you sereve it. In winter try serving it warm.</BLockquote></P>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>1 8oz. jar sundried tomatoes</li>
    <li>2 large garlic cloves</li>
    <li>2/3 c. kalamata olives</li>
    <li>1 t. capers</li>
</ul>

<h2>Instructions</h2>
<ol>
   <li>Combine tomatoes and garlic in a food processor. Blend until as smooth as possible.</li> 
    <li>Add capers and olives. Pulse the motor a few times until they are incorporated, but still retain some texture.</li>
    <li>Serve on thin toast rounds with goat cheese and fresh basil garnish (optional).</li>
</ol>

        <h2>Low and Slow</h2>
<p>posted by BGB, <time>November 15, 2016</time></p>
<p>This week I am <em>extremely</em> excited about a new cooking
technique called <dfn><i>sous vide</i></dfn>. In <i>sous vide</i>
cooking, you submerge the food (usually vacuum-sealed in plastic) into a
water bath that is precisely set to the target temperature you want the
food to be cooked to. In his book, <cite>Cooking for Geeks</cite>, Jeff
Potter describes it as <q>ultra-low-temperature poaching.</q></p>
<p>Next month, we will be serving <b><i>Sous Vide</i> Salmon with Dill
Hollandaise</b>. To reserve a seat at the chef table, contact us before
<time datetime="20161130">November 30</time>.</p>
Location: Bakerâ€™s Corner, Seekonk, MA
Hours: Tuesday to Saturday, 11am to 11pm
